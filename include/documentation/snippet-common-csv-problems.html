<h2>Common CSV file problems</h2>

<p>
CSV files must be plain text files, using 
<span style='background-color: #fce94f;'>&nbsp;,&nbsp;</span> 
as the entry separator, and 
<span style='background-color: #fce94f;'>&nbsp;"&nbsp;</span> 
as the optional quote character. 
The quote character is used to denote a cell if the entry separator is part of
the cell content. 
The first line is expected to represent the table header, 
all following lines are expected to represent table rows.
