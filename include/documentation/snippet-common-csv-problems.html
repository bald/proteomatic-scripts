<h2>Common CSV file problems</h2>

<p>
CSV files must be plain text files, using 
<span style='background-color: #fce94f;'>&nbsp;,&nbsp;</span> 
as the entry separator, and 
<span style='background-color: #fce94f;'>&nbsp;"&nbsp;</span> 
as the quote character. The first line is expected to represent 
the table header, all following lines are expected to represent table rows.
