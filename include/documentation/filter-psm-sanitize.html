<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<p>
This script addresses the problem of ambiguous MS/MS scan identifications where
multiple, different peptides are assigned to one MS/MS scan. 
As a result, individual peptide/spectral matches can get discarded for the
following three reasons.
</p>

<h3>1. A better-scoring peptide has been identified</h3>

<p>
In the following example, two different peptides have been identified in the
same MS/MS scan:
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Row</th><th>Scan</th><th>Peptide</th><th>E-value</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>example.1000.1000.2</td><td>GDDLGGNAAMSVYTK</td><td>2.6e-9</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>example.1000.1000.2</td><td>GDDLGGNAVCSVYTK</td><td>7.2e-3</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Here, peptide 2 gets discarded because peptide 1 has a better score and
is therefore more likely to be the correct explanation for the MS/MS scan.
</p>

<h3>2. Low hit distinctiveness</h3>

<p>
In the following example, two different peptides have been identified in the
same MS/MS scan. 
The score of peptide 2 is worse but almost as good as the score of peptide 1:
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Row</th><th>Scan</th><th>Peptide</th><th>E-value</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>example.1000.1000.2</td><td>GDDLGGNAAMSVYTK</td><td>1.30e-9</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>example.1000.1000.2</td><td>GDDLGGNAVCSVYTK</td><td>1.31e-9</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The <em>hit distinctiveness threshold</em> can be used to specify what is
considered to be "almost as good" in terms of order of magnitude. 
A value of 2 would correspond to a factor of 10<sup>2</sup>, thus requiring
the score ratio P2/P1 to be &ge; 100.
In this example, the score ratio is only 1.0077 and therefore, peptide 1
would be discarded because its identification is not distinctive enough.
In addition, peptide 2 would be discarded according to rule #1.
Consequently, no identifications for this scan would remain.
