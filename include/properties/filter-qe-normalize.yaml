title: Normalize protein levels

description: >
  This script multiplies all heavy amounts in a 
  <acronym title='quantitation event'>QE</acronym> list with a user-defined 
  factor to accomodate for protein loading differences. <br />
  <i>Example:</i> If you observe a ratio of 0.85 for a protein which should be 1.0,
  simply enter 0.85 into the 'Normalization factor' field. This will change
  all amounts in such a way that the protein's ratio will increase from 0.85
  to 1.0, and all other ratios will increase accordingly.
