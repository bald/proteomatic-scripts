title: Combine PBC combinations

description: >
  Combine individual protein-tagged peptide quantitation events into 
  protein quantitation events. This grouping is done on a peptide/band/charge
  combination basis. If multiple input files are specified, they are treated 
  as one (all QE are combined before evaluation).
