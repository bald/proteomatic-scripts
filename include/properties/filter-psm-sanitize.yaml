title: Sanitize PSM

description: >
  <p><b>Synopsis</b></p>
  Analyze PSM lists and remove hits to scans for which another hit with a 
  better score exists. In addition, hits to a scan with the same score but
  with contradicting peptides are discarded.
  <p><b>Background</b></p>
  In some cases, OMSSA may report multiple hits for a
  scan with slightly different scores and different peptides. By sanitizing
  PSM lists, you can be sure that no contradicting identifications remain
  and identified peptides and proteins can simply be extracted from the file.
