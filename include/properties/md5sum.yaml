title: Check MD5 sums

description: >
  <p>
  Determine the MD5 sum of a set of input files.
  </p>
  <p>
  All input files are sorted by filename (regardless of their directory) and 
  concatenated for the MD5 creation. This is done to ensure equal MD5 checksums 
  for equal sets of input files, regardless of the order the files are specified in.
